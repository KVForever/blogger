A blog (AKA web log) is an informational website designed to allow a user to post text information. These posts are often in a diary style and/or an indication of what is on the creator's thoughts at the given time.

A hashtag is a classification symbol which allows blog posts to be labeled as a set type. Users can use the hashtag for filtering blog posts to only those related to a specific interest.

In this assignment, web application will utilize these ideas to create a blog with hashtags. The data will be stored by the web server using a MongoDB database. Your server will host the files for the web application as well as host an application programming interface (API) to allow the client to retrieve, create, and delete blog posts.
